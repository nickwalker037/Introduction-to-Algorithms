The Role of Algorithms in Computing
Ch. 1 



Algorithm 
- Any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of vales, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output
    - is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output

Instance 
- refers to the input in the problem


What kind of problems are solved by algorithms?
- Human Genome Project
    - identifying all 100,000 genes in human DNA
- Navigation
- Search Engines
- Linear programming solves the following problems:
    - allocating resources most effectively
    - maximizing profit
    - effective customer service

** Not every problem solved by algorithms has an easily identified set of candidate solutions **
** Although 10 million numbers might seem like a lot, if the numbers are eight-byte integers, then the input occupies about 80 megabytes**
** Having a solid base of algorithmic knowledge and technique is one characteristic that separates the truly skilled programmers from the novices**

Data Structure
    - is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications
NP-Complete
    - means the problem currently isn’t solvable
Parallelism
    - is the idea of using multicore computers to make several sequential computers on a single chip
    - Ch. 27 - presents a model for “multithreaded” algorithms, which take advantage of multiple cores


Pseudocode
    - is not typically concerned with issues of software engineering
        - issues of data abstraction, modularity, and error handling are often ignored to convey the essence of the algorithm more concisely



Note:
- Python lacks repeat-until loops, and its for loops operate a little differently from the for loops in this book
