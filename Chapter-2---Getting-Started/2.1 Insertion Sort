2.1 Insertion Sort

- is an efficient algorithm for sorting a small number of elements

- Input - a sequence of n numbers (a1, a2, a3, ….., an)
- Output - a permutation (reordering) (a’1, a’2, a’3, ……., a’n) of the input sequence such that they increase in size as you approach n
Keys  - are the numbers we wish to sort


- for j = 2 to A.length
    - key = A[ j ] 
    - // insert A[ j ] into the sorted sequence A[1, …., j-1]
    - i = j - 1
    - while i = 0 and A[ i ] > key
        - A[ 1 + i ] = A[ i ]
        - i = i - 1
    - A[ i + 1 ] = key
